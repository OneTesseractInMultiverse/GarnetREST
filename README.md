## About GarnetREST

An implementation of a Flask-based Boilerplate for REST APIs and REST-based Microservices. The 
idea behind GarnetREST is to provide a base organization schema and some basic functionality that is 
present in most Web API Applications based on RESTful principles. GarnetREST provides:

* Support for MongoDB (Soon a version for Neo4j Graph Database will also be available)
* Support for Json Web Token (JWT) Generation and Authentication
* User account creation and management out-of-the-box
